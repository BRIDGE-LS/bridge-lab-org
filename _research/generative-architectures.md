# Generative Architectures

## Overview

The Generative Architectures research area focuses on developing innovative systems that can automatically design and generate software architectures tailored to specific requirements. Our goal is to create intelligent tools that assist software architects in producing optimal system designs that balance competing concerns such as performance, security, maintainability, and scalability.

## Research Focus Areas

### Requirement-Based Architecture Generation

We explore methods to automatically translate functional and non-functional requirements into appropriate architectural components and patterns. Our research includes:

- Natural language processing of requirement specifications
- Mapping requirements to architectural decisions
- Verification of architecture-requirement alignment

### Evolutionary Architecture Design

Our research investigates adaptive and evolutionary approaches to architecture generation:

- Genetic algorithms for exploring architectural design spaces
- Multi-objective optimization for balancing competing quality attributes
- Self-adaptive architectural patterns for changing environments

### Domain-Specific Architecture Generation

We develop specialized generators for particular domains and application types:

- Cloud-native application architectures
- Microservice composition and organization
- IoT system architectures
- High-performance computing designs

### Architecture Evaluation and Validation

We research methods to automatically evaluate generated architectures:

- Formal verification of architectural properties
- Performance prediction through simulation
- Security analysis through threat modeling

## Current Projects

- **ArchGen**: A tool that generates microservice architectures based on domain models and quality requirements
- **CloudArch**: A system that produces optimal cloud deployment architectures for distributed applications
- **SecArch**: A framework for generating security-focused architectures with built-in threat mitigation

## Industry Collaborations

Our research in generative architectures has practical applications across various industries. We work with partners to validate our approaches in real-world scenarios:

- Financial technology companies optimizing for both security and performance
- Healthcare systems requiring compliance with regulations and high availability
- E-commerce platforms balancing scalability and user experience
