# Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Complete Analysis

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open protocol** that **standardizes** how **applications** provide **context** to **language models (LLMs)**.
In other words: it defines a **communication standard** between **clients**, **servers**, and **LLMs**, allowing for the structured and modular integration of **data, tools, and workflows**.

> MCP is to LLMs what **USB-C** is to computers:
> - A **single standard** that allows different devices to be connected.
> - **Plug and play** of data, tools, and services into the flow of an LLM.

# Why is MCP important?

It solves practical, everyday problems for AI users:

| Current problem | Solution with MCP |
|----------------|------------------|
| Each integration with LLM is done "by hand", in a customized way | MCP creates a standard for integrating different sources and tools in a simple way |
| Difficulty in switching between LLM providers (e.g.: OpenAI → Anthropic) | MCP decouples the infrastructure from the models, facilitating portability |
| Weak security in direct integrations | MCP defines practices for data security within the company's infrastructure |

# General MCP Architecture

MCP adopts a **Client-Server architecture**:

| Element | Function |
|----------|--------|
| **MCP Hosts** | Programs that want to access data/context (e.g.: IDEs, Claude Desktop, AI Tools) |
| **MCP Clients** | MCP clients that connect to MCP servers |
| **MCP Servers** | Small programs that expose specific resources via MCP protocol |
| **Local Data Sources** | Local sources: files, databases, internal services |
| **Remote Services** | External services connected via APIs |

### Basic Flow
The **Host** uses an MCP **Client** → which connects to MCP **Servers** → which access **data and tools** → which are used as **context** for LLMs.

# Key Components and Concepts

1. **Resources** – Exposure of data or content that can be used by LLMs.
2. **Prompts** – Models or prompt templates that can be dynamically generated.
3. **Tools** – APIs or actions that LLMs can execute through the MCP server.
4. **Sampling** – Allows the server to request completions from LLMs directly. 5. **Roots** – Core context structures that organize how the server presents data to the client.
6. **Transports** – Communication mechanism (e.g. HTTP, WebSockets) used between client and server.

# What MCP offers in practice

- A **modular pattern** for building **lightweight servers** that expose specific information or capabilities.
- **Ready-made SDKs** in several languages ​​(Java, Python, C#, Kotlin, Typescript).
- A **vendor-agnostic approach** — you can switch from LLM (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) without having to rebuild everything.
- **Best practices** for secure, standardized, and auditable integration of context into AI workflows.

# MCP core capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-----------|
| **Easily connect and disconnect data sources** | No need to rewrite integrations for each source |
| **Interoperate between different LLMs** | Reduces technology dependency on a single provider |
| **Build complex agents and workflows** | With rich context from multiple servers |
| **Security built into the protocol** | Minimizes exposure and risk of sensitive data |
| **Ease of extension** | New server = new set of capabilities without breaking the system |
